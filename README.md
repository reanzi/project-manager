# project-manager

A Simple yet, elegant system to manage Projects securely; Created using React, Redux and Firebase as a Database.

The development proccess and the branches are arranged in a progressive manner; meaning every branch covers a step(s) towards the full app;
Master Branch Contain the full App; in case you get stuck somewhere just contact me;

All thanks to Shaun (the author of "The Net Ninja" channel on youtube)
